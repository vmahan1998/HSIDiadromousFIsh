# Introduction

Diadromous fish species exhibit an atypical migratory behavior between marine and freshwater environments, playing a pivotal role in the ecological and socio-economic fabric of coastal communities. Their migration enables access to essential resources, identification of suitable spawning grounds, and maintenance of population connectivity, contributing to the overall health and resilience of aquatic ecosystems (Durbin et al., 1979)(Walters et al., 2009). These migratory patterns are categorized into anadromy, involving spawning in fresh or brackish inland water, and catadromy, where reproduction occurs at sea (Limburg & Waldman, 2009). The economic and cultural implications of these migratory movements are significant, as diadromous fish provide essential food resources, support recreational fisheries, and hold cultural importance for coastal and indigenous communities. Understanding and conserving these remarkable migratory species are crucial for sustaining livelihoods, traditions, and cultural heritage associated with coastal communities.

In the Northeastern United States, diadromous fish populations have faced a historic decline over the past century due to dam construction in rivers, overexploitation, and pollution (Brown et al., 2000; Helfman, 2007; Limburg & Waldman, 2009; Hare et al., 2021). Since the enactment of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544), a total of 47 anadromous fish species or populations have been federally listed as endangered or threatened, underscoring the urgency for conservation efforts (Federally Integrated Species Health (FISH) Act, 2017). However, no federally listed catadromous fish species currently exist. Christensen et al. (2003) revealed a significant decline in the biomass of high-trophic level fishes in the North Atlantic over the past century, highlighting the far-reaching consequences of these population declines on coastal communities.

Effective fisheries management and conservation efforts necessitate an understanding of the habitat requirements and distribution patterns of diadromous fish species (Helfman, 2007). By studying and monitoring the habitats used by these fish, key areas for protection and restoration can be identified, sustainable fishing practices can be implemented, and measures can be taken to mitigate pollution and habitat alteration. Preserving and restoring these habitats are critical steps toward ensuring the recovery and resilience of diadromous fish populations, which, in turn, supports the economic viability and cultural identity of coastal communities.

Although existing HSI models have significantly contributed to understanding habitat preferences and guiding conservation efforts, it is important to acknowledge their limitations. Many of these models, developed based on the best available data and observations at the time, are outdated and often fail to accurately capture the complexity of diadromous fish populations. They are often based on data and observations that group together similar species, such as Atlantic and Shortnose Sturgeon or alewives and blueback herring, thereby overlooking the distinct ecological requirements and behaviors of these species (i.e., Pardue, 1983, add more ). Additionally, models can rely on observation methods that may not be directly applicable to specific ecosystems, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Habitat Evaluation Procedures Program, which primarily focuses on developing detailed models for assessing relatively small areas in terrestrial or freshwater environments, can introduce biases and hinder accurate assessments (USFWS 1980a, 1980b, 1981; Able et al., 2020).

Technological advancements such as acoustic telemetry, remote sensing, eDNA analysis, and high-resolution imaging have facilitated the increase in observations, studies, and data for diadromous fish behavior and movement. This wealth of new information has provided valuable insights into specific habitat requirements, migration patterns, and population dynamics of individual species within the diadromous fish community. To reflect these advancements more accurately, it is necessary to develop and refine additional HSI models.  

Refined models incorporating these index approaches will exhibit direct sensitivity to alterations in physical characteristics, ensuring a more precise representation of habitat suitability for each diadromous fish species. This improved accuracy enhances the assessment of the impact of changing environmental conditions on the distribution and abundance of diadromous fish throughout the Northeast United States, facilitating targeted conservation efforts and effective fisheries management strategies. These updated models can also account for the unique ecological characteristics of each species, enabling more precise assessments of their distribution and the identification of critical areas for juvenile and spawning adults. The objectives of this paper are to synthesize the latest life cycle observations, studies, and data on diadromous fish species in the Northeastern United States and develop updated species-specific habitat suitability index (HSI) models for Atlantic Salmon, Atlantic Sturgeon, Alewives, American Eels, American Shad, Atlantic Tomcod, Blueback Herring, Rainbow Smelt, Shortnose Sturgeon, and Striped Bass, considering their unique habitat preferences and ecological needs during the juvenile and spawning adult life stages. By achieving these objectives, this study aims to contribute to a broader understanding of diadromous fish ecology, support effective fisheries management, and inform conservation strategies for the benefit of both the species and the coastal communities dependent on them.
